MicroPython is a lean implementation of the Python 3 programming language that has been pared down to run efficiently 
on microcontrollers. Python is a relatively simple (but powerful) language that is easy for beginners to pick up and has been
gaining popularity in schools as an introductory language. MicroPython has nearly all of the features of Python, which means that 
interacting with hardware is now easily accessible to beginners and seasoned
Python programmers alike.
